## Key Features

### Area Specific Lighting
Each light in the scene is a point light. "point" is a "type" attribute of the element "a-light", a point light radiates in all (6) directions within a specify "radius" attribute. Each light only covers a specific area in the scene, which gives the user a more realistic feeling.

Take the dining area light for example
'''html
<a-entity position="4.797 2.164 3.298" id="table_light_entity" >
<a-light
type= "point" intensity= "3" distance= "3" id="table_light_source">
</a-light>
</a-entity>
'''
